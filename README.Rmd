# annotreer

<!-- badges: start -->

This package provides one function, `annotree()`, which is a wrapper for `rpart.plot::prp()`. By employing customized labeling functions under the hood, `annotree()` helps us visualize complexity parameter calculations. These annotations are helpful for explaining CART's pruning algorithm. 

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jtr13/annotreer")
```

## Example

Did you ever create a classification tree with **rpart**, view the `cptable` returned and wonder how the columns were calculated? This package creates custom label functions and then calls `rpart.plot::prp()` to create tree diagrams that will aid in understanding how this table summarizes the pruning options. Let's start with an example.

We create a large tree with `rpart::rpart()` and visualize it with `annotree()`. The data is from the **rpart** package:

```{r}
library(rpart)
head(kyphosis)
```

`Kyphosis` -- type of deformation `absent` or `present` after surgery

`Age` -- in months

`Number` -- the number of vertebrae involved

`Start` -- the number of the first (topmost) vertebra operated on

The goal is to classify the `Kyphosis` variable based on `Age`, `Number` and `Start`. By setting the parameter `show_classes = TRUE` in the call to `annotree()` below, the nodes are labeled with class labels and class counts. 

```{r example, fig.width=10, fig.retina=2}
kmod <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, data = kyphosis, cp = 0, minsplit = 2)
library(annotreer)
annotree(kmod, show_classes = TRUE)
```

Since we set the parameters of `rpart()` to grow as large a tree as possible, the deviance for all of the leaf nodes is zero: every leaf node has a zero for one of the classes. We can make the deviance of the leaves more explict by setting `show_leaf_dev` to `TRUE`:

```{r}
annotree(kmod, show_classes = TRUE, show_leaf_dev = TRUE)
```

Now we turn to the pruning process. `rpart()` returns a `cptable` which provides pruning options. Following the cost complexity pruning algorithm of CART (see Breiman, et al. 1984) the table does not show every possible subtree, only the ones produced by sequentially pruning the next weakest link until the tree is reduced to a single node.  

In this particular case, we are given 6 options shown in the `nsplit` column: 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 16 splits. Each of the larger subtrees contains the smaller ones, as we'll see when we get into the details of the pruning process.

```{r}
kmod$cptable
```

The `CP` column shows the minimum complexity parameter for a tree of the corresponding number of splits. For example if we set the `cp` value to a number below `0.07843` and above `0.05882`, when pruning, the subtree will have 5 splits:

```{r, fig.height=6, out.width="60%"}
annotree(prune(kmod, cp = .06), main = "Pruned with cp = .06")
```

## How the cptable is created

To understand how `rpart()` is created we'll start with some definitions:

* A *branch* includes an internal node and all of its descendants.

* *Pruning* a branch refers to removing all of the descendants of a node, i.e. collapsing them into the root node of the branch.

* A *subtree* refers to the original tree after pruning.

The algorithm for pruning a classification tree begins with calculating the deviance reduction *per split* for all internal nodes on the large tree. In this context, deviance means misclassified cases, which differs from the tree growing process in which the Gini index, not the number misclassified, is used to determine the next optimal split.

The `CP` values in the table are a scaled version of $g(t)$, the cost complexity value, which is a direct measure of the misclassification reduction *per split*. For example, if it takes two splits to reduce the number of misclassified by one, then $g(t)$ would equal `0.5`. We'll work in terms of $g(t)$ since it's more intuitive, and return to `CP` later on.

More formally, for all internal nodes of the tree,

$g(t) = \frac{R(t) - R(T_t)}{|\tilde{T}_t| - 1},$ where

* $t$ is a node in the decision tree,

* $T_t$ is the subtree rooted at node $t$, including $t$ and all of its descendants,

* $\tilde{T}_t$ is the set of terminal (leaf) nodes in the subtree $T_t$,

* $R(t)$ is the risk at node $t$, in this case, the deviance or misclassified cases,

* $R(T_t)$ is the total risk of the subtree $T_t$, meaning the sum of risks at all terminal nodes in $T_t$, and

* $|\tilde{T}_t|$ is the number of terminal nodes (leaves) in the subtree $T_t$,.

Less formally it's the misclassification reduction *per split*, or,

$g(t)$ = (the difference between the deviance of node $t$ and the sum of the deviance of node $t$'s leaf descendents) / (number of splits in branch $t$)

For example, let's consider the branch with root node 22 in the original large tree. We have:

* deviance of branch: 0 (sum of misclassified in leaf nodes)

* deviance of node: 2 (misclassified in node)

* number of splits in branch: 4 (nodes 22, 44, 89, 45)

Thus $g(t) = \frac{2 - 0}{4} = 0.5$

That is, it takes 4 splits to reduce the deviance from 2 to 0, which averages to a 0.5 reduction per split. 

The tree below displays $g(t)$ for all branches:

```{r}
annotree(kmod, show_classes = FALSE, show_gt = TRUE,
         show_leaf_dev = TRUE, show_internal_dev = TRUE)
```

By setting `show_min` to `TRUE` we can add "*minimum" to the labels for node(s) with the minimum value for $g(t)$. Adding `show_pruned` changes the color of these nodes and their descendents:

```{r}
annotree(kmod, show_classes = FALSE, show_gt = TRUE,
         show_leaf_dev = TRUE, show_internal_dev = TRUE, 
         show_min = TRUE, show_pruned = TRUE)
```

The weakest links have $g(t) = 0.5$.

In **rpart** these are scaled so that the root node has an error of 1, accomplished by dividing all values of `g(t)` by the deviance of the root node. In this case it is `17`, so the scaled complexity parameter (henceforth, cp) is `0.5/17 = 0.0294`. We will redraw the tree with the scaled values by changing `show_gt = TRUE` to `show_cp = TRUE`:

```{r}
annotree(kmod, show_classes = FALSE, show_cp = TRUE,
         show_leaf_dev = TRUE, show_internal_dev = TRUE, 
         show_min = TRUE, show_pruned = TRUE)
```

To save space, henceforth we will only show the scaled values.

To determine the next threshold we need to recalculate $g(t)$ or `cp`. This is necessary because pruning the tree changes the cost reductions for the remaining nodes. We will set `cp` to a value slightly above the minimum; we choose `.03`.

```{r, fig.height=7}
kmod2 <- prune(kmod, cp = .03)
annotree(kmod2, show_classes = FALSE, show_cp = TRUE,
         show_leaf_dev = TRUE, show_internal_dev = TRUE, 
         show_min = TRUE, show_pruned = TRUE)
```

We continue in this way until the tree is reduced to a single node:

```{r, fig.height=5}
kmod3 <- prune(kmod2, cp = .06)
annotree(kmod3, show_classes = FALSE, show_cp = TRUE,
         show_leaf_dev = TRUE, show_internal_dev = TRUE, 
         show_min = TRUE, show_pruned = TRUE)
```


```{r, fig.height=4}
kmod4 <- prune(kmod3, cp = .08)
annotree(kmod4, show_classes = FALSE, show_cp = TRUE,
         show_leaf_dev = TRUE, show_internal_dev = TRUE, 
         show_min = TRUE, show_pruned = TRUE)
```


```{r, fig.height=4}
kmod5 <- prune(kmod4, cp = .12)
annotree(kmod5, show_classes = FALSE, show_cp = TRUE,
         show_leaf_dev = TRUE, show_internal_dev = TRUE, 
         show_min = TRUE, show_pruned = TRUE)
```


```{r, fig.height=4}
kmod6 <- prune(kmod5, cp = .18)
annotree(kmod6, show_classes = TRUE, show_cp = TRUE,
         show_leaf_dev = TRUE, show_internal_dev = TRUE, 
         show_min = TRUE, show_pruned = TRUE)
```

Note that the weakest links in the trees above correspond to the values in `cptable`. We have replicated the process by which the original tree is successively pruned at the new weakest link:

```{r}
kmod$cptable
```

Again, the table shows the minimum `CP` value for a particular number of splits. (Due to rounding in the display, the actual number may be slightly higher.)

The `rel error` displays the sum of the misclassified cases for a tree of the size indicated *divided by* the misclassified cases in the root node (`nsplit` = 0) to ensure that the `rel error` of a tree with no splits is one. 

In this case we have:

```{r}
data.frame(nsplit = kmod$cptable[, "nsplit"],
           misclassified = 17*kmod$cptable[, "rel error"])
```

which corresponds to the misclassified cases in the trees shown above.
