# annotreer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of annotreer is to provide a wrapper to `rpart.plot::prp()` to make it easier to label decision tree plots with complexity parameter calculations. These annotations are helpful for explaining CART's pruning algorithm.

## Installation

You can install the development version of annotreer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jtr13/annotreer")
```

## Example

```{r example, fig.width=10, fig.retina=2}
library(annotreer)
library(rpart)
kmod <- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, data = kyphosis, cp = 0, minsplit = 2)
annotree(kmod)
```
